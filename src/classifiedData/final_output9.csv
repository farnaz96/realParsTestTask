As an important component of the SENTRON protective components for electronic installations, the LV HRC fuse system from Siemens provides effective protection for personnel, equipment and plants by means of a reliable shutdown function in the event of an overload or short-circuit. Higher short-circuit currents and better current limitation can be achieved than with miniature circuit breakers. Key features of the LV HRC fuse system: 1. Combination alarms signal the tripping of a fuse by a clear color change from red to white. 2. Greater safety when replacing thanks to insulated grip lugs. 3. High selectivity at low cost. 4. Long-term and safe operation thanks to silver-plated contact blades. 5. Fuse links are available rated from 2 A to 1250 A and in sizes 000, 00, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 4a. www.siemens.com/fuses.

As an important component of the SENTRON protective components for electronic installations, the LV HRC fuse system from Siemens provides effective protection for personnel, equipment and plants by means of a reliable shutdown function in the event of an overload or short-circuit. Higher short-circuit currents and better current limitation can be achieved than with miniature circuit breakers. Key features of the LV HRC fuse system: 1. Combination alarms signal the tripping of a fuse by a clear color change from red to white. 2. Greater safety when replacing thanks to insulated grip lugs. 3. High selectivity at low cost. 4. Long-term and safe operation thanks to silver-plated contact blades. 5.

As an important component of the SENTRON protective components for electronic installations, the LV HRC fuse system from Siemens provides effective protection for personnel, equipment and plants by means of a reliable shutdown function in the event of an overload or short-circuit. Higher short-circuit currents and better current limitation can be achieved than with miniature circuit breakers. Key features of the LV HRC fuse system: 1. Combination alarms signal the tripping of a fuse by a clear color change from red to white. 2. Greater safety when replacing thanks to insulated grip lugs. 3. High selectivity at low cost. 4. Long-term and safe operation thanks to silver-plated contact blades. 5.

There are numerous possible applications for the 3LD disconnector units. After disconnects from the grid, they ensure safe activation of all of the electrical equipment, thus switch, for example, to three-phase motors, but also air-conditioning and ventilation systems. 3LD have proven themselves in many fields, particularly in processing machines in mechanical and conveyor system engineering, and in the chemical sector and food and beverage industries. Key features of the Siemens 3LD main and emergency off switches: 1. Modular design, fast and easy mounting of auxiliary switches, N-PE terminal, or 4-pole 2. Versatile and global applications possible thanks to international IEC, UL and marine approvals. 3. Degree of protection IP65 with encapsulated housing for outdoor applications. 4.

There are numerous possible applications for the 3LD disconnector units. After disconnects from the grid, they ensure safe activation of all of the electrical equipment, thus switch, for example, to three-phase motors, but also air-conditioning and ventilation systems. 3LD have proven themselves in many fields, particularly in processing machines in mechanical and conveyor system engineering, and in the chemical sector and food and beverage industries. Key features of the Siemens 3LD main and emergency off switches: 1. Modular design, fast and easy mounting of auxiliary switches, N-PE terminal, or 4-pole 2. Versatile and global applications possible thanks to international IEC, UL and marine approvals. 3. Degree of protection IP65 with encapsulated housing for outdoor applications. 4. Can be used for DC applications. 5. Types of mounting: Front mounting, mounting plate, standard mounting rail. 6. Optimized disconnect from 16 A to 250 A with lockable rotary operating mechanism. www.siemens.com/switching-devices.

There are numerous possible applications for the 3LD disconnector units. After disconnects from the grid, they ensure safe activation of all of the electrical equipment, thus switch, for example, to three-phase motors, but also air-conditioning and ventilation systems. 3LD have proven themselves in many fields, particularly in processing machines in mechanical and conveyor system engineering, and in the chemical sector and food and beverage industries. Key features of the Siemens 3LD main and emergency off switches: 1. Modular design, fast and easy mounting of auxiliary switches, N-PE terminal, or 4-pole 2. Versatile and global applications possible thanks to international IEC, UL and marine approvals. 3. Degree of protection IP65 with encapsulated housing for outdoor applications. 4. Can be used for DC applications. 5. Types of mounting: Front mounting, mounting plate, standard mounting rail. 6. Optimized disconnect from 16 A to 250 A with lockable rotary operating mechanism. www.siemens.com/switching-devices. Siemens offers a comprehensive portfolio of protection, switching, measuring and monitoring devices, distribution systems as well as switches and sockets for safe and efficient electrical infrastructure in buildings and industry.</p><p></p><a href=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0078/1084/2724/files/3LD25651TC51_datasheet.pdf target=_blank aria-describedby=a11y-new-window-external-message rel=noopener noreferrer>3LD switch disconnector, main switch, 4-pole, Iu: 63 A, operating power/... motor - 3LD2565-1TC51<strong><span></span> Datasheet</strong></a><ul></ul>",Siemens,"SENTRON, Switch disconnector 3LD, main switch, 4-p","emergency stop switch, load switch, Main switch, on/off switch, Sentron, switching device",1,Title,Default Title,953,shopify,45000,continue,manual,123,1,1,1,nan,0,g,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,3LD2565-1TC51,https://static.siemens.com/mimes/10001000PNG/G_I202_XX_32572P.png,Shop All;Relay & Switch/Fuse,nan,nan,nan

Can be used flexibly thanks to a compact design and wide range of accessories. 3. Improved safety during maintenance works thanks to padlock locking. 4. Quick installation on the standard mounting rail with frame sizes up to 160 A. 5. Efficient engineering with extensive CAx data. 6. Simple documentation with the manual configurator. 7. Ideal for a continuous power supply (UPS) e.g. in computer rooms, production lines in continuous operation or large infrastructure such as airports (RTSE and ATSE variants). www.siemens.com/switching-devices.

The motor can be combined with the SINAMICS V90 converter and the MOTION-CONNECT 300 connection system to create a powerful servo system with high functionality. This produces an integrated drive system. Wherever highly dynamic and precise motion sequences are demanded, the drive system comprising the SIMOTICS S-1FL6 and SINAMICS V90 is the first choice. Users benefit from the high dynamics, precision and compactness. The SIMOTICS S-1FL6 servo motor is a permanently excited synchronous motor designed for operation without external cooling. The heat is dissipated via the surface of the motor. Thanks to the use of a quick-release connector, the motors are quick and easy to install. The servo motor with high dynamics and low inertia is available in four shaft heights and a braking performance of between 0.05 kW and 2.00 kW. The motor has IP65 protection and self-cooling as standard. The servo motor covers the ranges of rated torque from 0.16 Nm to 6.37 Nm and rated speed from 3000 rpm to 5000 rpm. In addition, the motor has a TTL 2500 ppr incremental encoder.
