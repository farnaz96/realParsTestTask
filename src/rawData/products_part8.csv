The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (parallel, via ASi or IO-Link): Integrated auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The front-panel terminals simplify the wiring. The 3RT2 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range with AC and DC operation. In addition to screw terminals, all the devices are also available with spring-type terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.
The comprehensive range of accessories, such as auxiliary switches, auxiliary releases etc. is standardized for all sizes. The available link modules, function modules and the SIRIUS 3RV29 infeed system considerably reduce the wiring expense.
The 3RT2 power contactors replace the well-proven 3RT1 series (up to 55 kW).

The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (parallel, via ASi or IO-Link): Integrated auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The front-panel terminals simplify the wiring. The 3RT2 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range with AC and DC operation. In addition to screw terminals, all the devices are also available with spring-type terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.
The comprehensive range of accessories, such as auxiliary switches, auxiliary releases etc. is standardized for all sizes. The available link modules, function modules and the SIRIUS 3RV29 infeed system considerably reduce the wiring expense.
The 3RT2 power contactors replace the well-proven 3RT1 series (up to 55 kW).

The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (parallel, via ASi or IO-Link): Integrated auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The front-panel terminals simplify the wiring. The 3RT2 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range with AC and DC operation. In addition to screw terminals, all the devices are also available with spring-type terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.
The comprehensive range of accessories, such as auxiliary switches, auxiliary releases etc. is standardized for all sizes. The available link modules, function modules and the SIRIUS 3RV29 infeed system considerably reduce the wiring expense.
The 3RT2 power contactors replace the well-proven 3RT1 series (up to 55 kW).

The 3RT2 contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance from a compact design with high contact reliability. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. Many of the device combinations have been factory tested. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (parallel, via ASi or IO-Link): Integrated auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The front-panel terminals simplify the wiring. The 3RT2 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range with AC and DC operation. In addition to screw terminals, all the devices are also available with spring-type terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.
The comprehensive range of accessories, such as auxiliary switches, auxiliary releases etc. is standardized for all sizes. The available link modules, function modules and the SIRIUS 3RV29 infeed system considerably reduce the wiring expense.
The 3RT2 power contactors replace the well-proven 3RT1 series (up to 55 kW).

The 3RT1 contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance and high contact reliability despite their compact design. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready. This version is characterized by an extended operating and temperature range for tougher ambient conditions.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They have a DC wide voltage range and a PLC control input. The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-loaded terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.
A wide range of accessories is available for these contactors, such as wiring kits that considerably reduce wiring outlay, auxiliary switches or terminal covers.

The 3RT1 contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance from a compact design with high contact reliability. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant and approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA).
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They can be operated with AC or DC, and some versions have a wide voltage range and a PLC control input.  The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-type terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.
A wide range of accessories is available for these contactors, such as wiring kits that considerably reduce wiring outlay, auxiliary switches or terminal covers.

The 3RT12 vacuum contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance and high contact reliability despite their compact design. The vacuum contactors are also characterized by their particularly high switching endurance. They are therefore particularly well suited to frequent switching in jog mode. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They have a DC wide voltage range and a PLC control input. The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-loaded terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.

The 3RT12 vacuum contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance and high contact reliability despite their compact design. The vacuum contactors are also characterized by their particularly high switching endurance. They are therefore particularly well suited to frequent switching in jog mode. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They have a DC wide voltage range and a PLC control input. The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-loaded terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.

The 3RT12 vacuum contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance and high contact reliability despite their compact design. The vacuum contactors are also characterized by their particularly high switching endurance. They are therefore particularly well suited to frequent switching in jog mode. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They have a DC wide voltage range and a PLC control input. The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-loaded terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.

The 3RT12 vacuum contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance and high contact reliability despite their compact design. The vacuum contactors are also characterized by their particularly high switching endurance. They are therefore particularly well suited to frequent switching in jog mode. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They have a DC wide voltage range and a PLC control input. The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-loaded terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.

The 3RT12 vacuum contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance and high contact reliability despite their compact design. The vacuum contactors are also characterized by their particularly high switching endurance. They are therefore particularly well suited to frequent switching in jog mode. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They have a DC wide voltage range and a PLC control input. The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-loaded terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.

The 3RT12 vacuum contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance and high contact reliability despite their compact design. The vacuum contactors are also characterized by their particularly high switching endurance. They are therefore particularly well suited to frequent switching in jog mode. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They have a DC wide voltage range and a PLC control input. The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-loaded terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.

The 3RT12 vacuum contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance and high contact reliability despite their compact design. The vacuum contactors are also characterized by their particularly high switching endurance. They are therefore particularly well suited to frequent switching in jog mode. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They have a DC wide voltage range and a PLC control input. The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-loaded terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.

The 3RT12 vacuum contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance and high contact reliability despite their compact design. The vacuum contactors are also characterized by their particularly high switching endurance. They are therefore particularly well suited to frequent switching in jog mode. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They have a DC wide voltage range and a PLC control input. The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-loaded terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.

The 3RT12 vacuum contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance and high contact reliability despite their compact design. The vacuum contactors are also characterized by their particularly high switching endurance. They are therefore particularly well suited to frequent switching in jog mode. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. The 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant, approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA) and are IE3/IE4-ready.
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They have a DC wide voltage range and a PLC control input. The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-loaded terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.

The 3RT1 contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance from a compact design with high contact reliability. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant and approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA).
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They can be operated with AC or DC, and some versions have a wide voltage range and a PLC control input.  The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-type terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.
A wide range of accessories is available for these contactors, such as wiring kits that considerably reduce wiring outlay, auxiliary switches or terminal covers.

The 3RT1 contactors are part of the modular SIRIUS system with its optimally coordinated products. They offer convincing performance from a compact design with high contact reliability. They can be combined with a variety of other components in the load feeder. The contactors offer the best connection to the automation level for every application (direct or via PLC input). Pre-installed auxiliary switches reduce the complexity of your design. 3RT1 contactors are climate-resistant and approved for worldwide use (e.g. IEC and UL/CSA).
They are available in various sizes and in a wide performance range. They can be operated with AC or DC, and some versions have a wide voltage range and a PLC control input.  The devices can be connected in the main circuit by means of rails or box terminals. For the auxiliary and control circuit they are also available with spring-type terminals for fast, maintenance-free and vibration-proof connection.
A wide range of accessories is available for these contactors, such as wiring kits that considerably reduce wiring outlay, auxiliary switches or terminal covers.

Thanks to galvanic separation, the signal converters prevent mutual interference between the analog channels. Thanks to the narrow and compact design, they take up little space on the mounting rail, particularly in flat control boxes and control cabinets with small gaps between tiers The high-quality, modern design in titanium gray contributes to the integrated appearance matching all other Siemens devices in the control cabinet. The clear range of devices covers all applications and thus simplifies logistics and stock-keeping.
Active and passive single-range, multi-range and universal converters are available with various supply voltages and connection types for various analog standard signals and other common sensor signals. In addition, we offer versions with manual/automatic switchover for precise specification of analog values.
