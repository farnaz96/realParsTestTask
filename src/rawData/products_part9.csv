As an important component of the SENTRON protective components for electronic installations, the LV HRC fuse system from Siemens provides effective protection for personnel, equipment and plants by means of a reliable shutdown function in the event of an overload or short-circuit. Higher short-circuit currents and better current limitation can be achieved than with miniature circuit breakers. Key features of the LV HRC fuse system: 1. Combination alarms signal the tripping of a fuse by a clear color change from red to white. 2. Greater safety when replacing thanks to insulated grip lugs. 3. High selectivity at low cost. 4. Long-term and safe operation thanks to silver-plated contact blades. 5. Fuse links are available rated from 2 A to 1250 A and in sizes 000, 00, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 4a. www.siemens.com/fuses.

The motor can be combined with the SINAMICS V90 converter and the MOTION-CONNECT 300 connection system to create a powerful servo system with high functionality. This produces an integrated drive system. Wherever highly dynamic and precise motion sequences are demanded, the drive system comprising the SIMOTICS S-1FL6 and SINAMICS V90 is the first choice. Users benefit from the high dynamics, precision and compactness. The SIMOTICS S-1FL6 servo motor is a permanently excited synchronous motor designed for operation without external cooling. The heat is dissipated via the surface of the motor. Thanks to the use of a quick-release connector, the motors are quick and easy to install. The servo motor with high dynamics and low inertia is available in four shaft heights and a braking performance of between 0.05 kW and 2.00 kW. The motor has IP65 protection and self-cooling as standard. The servo motor covers the ranges of rated torque from 0.16 Nm to 6.37 Nm and rated speed from 3000 rpm to 5000 rpm. In addition, the motor has a TTL 2500 ppr incremental encoder. The SIMOTICS S-1FL6 servo motor can be adapted to address specific user requirements using various options such as connectors, encoders and additional accessories.
